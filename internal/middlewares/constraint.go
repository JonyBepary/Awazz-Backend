// This is a Go middleware function that processes OPTIONS requests and adds CORS headers to the response. The function takes an `http.Handler` as input and returns a new `http.Handler` that wraps the input handler.
// The `Constraint` function first checks if the request has an `Origin` header, which indicates that it is a cross-origin request. If it does, the function sets the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header to the value of the `Origin` header, which allows the browser to make cross-origin requests to the server. It also sets other CORS headers like `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`, `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`, and `Access-Control-Max-Age`.
// If the request method is `OPTIONS`, the function returns a blank response with the `views.RenderBlankResponse` function. This is because the browser sends an OPTIONS request before making a cross-origin request to check if the server allows the request. The blank response tells the browser that the server allows the request.
// If the request method is not `OPTIONS`, the function calls the input handler's `ServeHTTP` method to handle the request. This allows the middleware to be used with any handler that implements the `http.Handler` interface.
